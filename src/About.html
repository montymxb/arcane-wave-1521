<h1>About</h1>

<h2 class = "grayText">
	A little info.
</h2>

<p class = "stdIntroItem" style = "text-align: left;">
	My name is Benjamin Wilson Friedman (I also go under the pseudonym -mxb-), and my passion is creating. Whether physically or mentally the enjoyment is equivalent. I started out building simple things when I was young.
	Eventually I progressed onto more complex projects that eventually became a habit of engineering. Things like learning to repair small engines on yard tools, to fog machines powered by baby oil and other custom designed mechanical devices.
	I would have continued to progress mechanically, as it would seem 'only natural'. Yet there are limitations on what we can physically achieve with our hands, and although limits are fantastic bars to work towards, they can stifle one's creative capacity.
	My personal sensibilites are still rooted in the gears and wrenches of my past, but now my creativity is unlimited in the world of software.
	<br><br>
	Since getting started in software I have found nothing but more motivation to continue onto increasingly more complicated and advanced topics.
	I started with only a vague idea of programming, and now it is one of my favorite (and strongest) suites.
	I've also found scripting to be exceptionally useful, particularly bash!
	Over the years I've been working in Java, C, Objective-C, Lua and PHP; among others.
	<br><br>
	I can say my proudest work is Bit Shooter.
	Something that started out as little more than an attempt to replicate a game I made when I was young.
	It eventually took on a shape of it's own, and turned into what it is today, a neat little shooter!
	Although it is nothing to gawk at, the time, research, and effort involved was tremendous.
	Once I decided to begin an iOS version that difficulty seemed nearly insurmountable.
	Still, this posed a challenge that I was more than willing to tackle!
	<br><br>
	Today Bit Shooter on Android is currently something far more advanced that I ever thought it could be.
	The iOS version is also quite intricate as well, featuring OpenGL & OpenAL setups that had to be properly designed (as well as understood) to make building them reasonable.
	Considering all of this the task of managing both versions and bringing them both up to date with each other was particularly tough at first.
	Figuring out how to write not only code but programmed systems that were equivalent in different languages, on different platforms, is not easy.
	However the journey has been an amazing one, and to imagine that I have amassed this much in so little time is just icing on the cake.
	I intend to continue to add to this app periodically, and tend to it as need be.
	<br><br>
	My overall intent is to start a company of my own to further my goal of realizing not only the ideas of my self but those of others.
	I will work to put my heart into it, so that such a company, when I bring it to reality, can be something more than just a business.
	<br><br>
	Sincerely,<br>Benjamin Wilson Friedman
	<!--
	Ideas are an amazing thing.
	One can be born from seemingly nothing, and then after time it can grow into something great.
	UphouseWorks believes that software is a key component to the realization of ideas, allowing aspects to be achieved that could otherwise not be realized.
	The harnessing of mobile applications to reach one's goals is a relatively recent development in the past two decades.
	However we believe there is always more to be seen, and that we will be able to build farther than before with software.
	The goal of UphouseWorks is to ultimately harness this ability to create using software for the benefit of all.
	Our Ideas will lead us to offer more development options on a wider variety of platforms, in order to allow the fruition of others' dreams.
	It is those dreams, and those who choose to follow them, that will bring the progress and change that is expected in this day and age.

    State issue here, just need to be able to tell whether
