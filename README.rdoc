# Very Very Old UPHW site

This is a recovery of the original UPHW site I created back in 2013-2014. It was hosted on Heroku as a Ruby on Rails application, but here it's been consolidated as a static site again. This is more for historical reference than anything, as I nearly forgot I even had an application on Heroku after 7 years or so.
